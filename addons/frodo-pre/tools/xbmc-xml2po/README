XBMC-XML2PO 0.96 by Team XBMC 2012

This command-line utility is for converting XBMC strings.xml files into strings.po
and strings.pot files used from XBMC Frodo and can be used directly in
any web based community driven translation system, like Transifex.

Usage: xbmc-xml2po -s <sourcedirectoryname> (-p <projectname>) (-v <version>)
 -s <name> for source root language directory, which contains the language dirs

The source directory for addons should be where the addon.xml file exists
For core language file, use the main xbmc source tree as a directory

Note for Windows users: In case you have whitespace or any special character
in any of the arguments, please use apostrophe around them. For example:
xbmc-xml2po.exe -s "C:\xbmc dir\"

With any issues, please report to alanwww1@xbmc.org
