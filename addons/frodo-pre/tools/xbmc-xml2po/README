XBMC-XML2PO 0.95 by Team XBMC 2012

This command-line utility is for converting XBMC strings.xml files into strings.po
and strings.pot files used from XBMC Frodo and can be used directly in
any web based community driven translation system, like Transifex.

Usage: xbmc-xml2po -s <sourcedirectoryname> (-p <projectname>) (-v <version>)
 -s <name> for source root language directory, which contains the language dirs
 -p <name> for project name, eg. xbmc.skin.confluence
 -v <name> for project version, eg. FRODO_GIT251373f9c3
 
Note for Windows users: In case you have whitespace or any special character
in any of the arguments, please use apostrophe around them. For example:
xbmc-xml2po.exe -s "C:\xbmc dir\language" -p xbmc.core -v Frodo_GIT

Or just copy the xbmc-xml2po.exe file into your source tree and run for example:
xbmc-xml2po.exe -s language -p xbmc.core -v FRODO_GIT
